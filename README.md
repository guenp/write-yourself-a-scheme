<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I'm studying F# recently and looking for the first F# project to work with. I remembered that the awesome "Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 hours" book which was written in haskell.
This tutorial is pretty practical. So I thought why not forking it and do it again using F#! 
After implementing the Scheme repl in F# following this book, I think it would be great to share my expereince and that's why I'm writing this tutorial.
